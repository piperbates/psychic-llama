<!--
Welcome to my attempt at a magic eight ball. I actually attempted this a few years ago but couldn't manage it
but have now learnt a bunch more stuff which means I can make it work.

A few bugs exist. I don't know how to make it work if the user presses the enter key, currently it just deletes 
the input field and they have to reinsert their question and click the button. Need to find out  how to make the
code work on enter, instead of just clicking the button.

Have also changed some questions around and added some more preset questions / answers :)

Enjoy! 

Piper
